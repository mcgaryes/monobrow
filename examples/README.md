There are currently only examples for a node server and client. Setting up a web client is fairly easy and maps almost directly to the node client. 

There is an Objective-C example included with the `monobrow-client-objc` source files. The example is an OSX application, but the code should translate quite easily to ios.

Please let me know if there is something specific that you'd like to see and i'd be more than happy to throw it together.
