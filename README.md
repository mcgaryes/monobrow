### Overview

Like the left brow sometimes needs to converse with the right, Monobrow aims to serve the same purpose for different technologies. It provides a simple, abstracted, messaging protocol that makes it easy to message from one language/platform to another.

### Using Monobrow

Using monobrow is a simple. 

1. Setup a server
* Create a client or two
* Start conversing!

To get started with the server and clients check out the their respective README markdown.

### What's it good for?

* Prototypes where its easier to write certain bits of an application in multiple languages.

* Products where you want to take advantage of the speed of one language to another.

### What it isn't good for?

* Older browsers. There is no fallback for browsers that do not support websockets.

* Messaging where data needs to be secure. Currently doesnt support any faction of security protocol, and there is no planned development in the near future (although patches are welcome to support this).

### Roadmap

* Plans to build out clients for Processing.
* Examples illustrating simple and complex implementations.
